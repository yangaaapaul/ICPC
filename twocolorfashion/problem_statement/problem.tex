You are this year’s coordinator for the annual fashion show at Virginia Tech’s culture show. 
The models this year are trying as much as possible to have matching colors and the theme
is rainbow, so we’ll represent each color by its letter. Determine the longest chain of models
that we can have with two distinct colors. 

\section*{Input}

The input begins with an integer $n$ ($1 < n < 100\,000$) that denotes the number
of colors.  The next line contains $n$ uppercase English letters.

\section*{Output}

Display the length of the longest chain with two distinct colors.
If there are multiple correct answers output the first one found.
